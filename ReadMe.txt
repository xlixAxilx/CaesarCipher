A Caesar cipher is a simple cryptographic technique in which each letter in the original message is shifted to a different letter which is located at a uniform offset in alphabetical order.
For example, the message “Hello World!” and offset 3 would result in an encrypted message “Khoor Zruog!” 
The message “Dogs and Cats” and offset -2 (which is equivalent to an offset of 24) would result in an encrypted message “Bmeq ylb Ayrq”
Only alphabetic characters are shifted, and that the case of the letter is preserved.
Command of use:

<pathname> <input_file> <output_file> <offset>
